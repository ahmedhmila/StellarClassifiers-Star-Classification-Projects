# StellarClassifiers : Star Classification Projects

This repository contains multiple datasets and Jupyter notebooks, each dedicated to the classification of stars based on various attributes. The primary goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of stars and their types, in preparation for larger, upcoming projects involving star identification.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple folders, each containing a unique dataset and corresponding Jupyter notebook. The structure is as follows:

```
.
├── Folder1
│   ├── Dataset1
│   └── Notebook1
├── Folder2
│   ├── Dataset2
│   └── Notebook2
.
.
.
└── FolderN
    ├── DatasetN
    └── NotebookN
```

## Datasets

Each dataset contains different attributes of stars that are used to classify them into various types. The attributes may include temperature, luminosity, radius, absolute magnitude, etc. Each dataset is unique and provides a different perspective on star classification.

## Notebooks

Each Jupyter notebook corresponds to a dataset and contains Python code used for the classification of stars. The notebooks include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired folder.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, etc.).
4. Run the cells in the notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.)

## Acknowledgments

- Star data providers
- Open source community
